This project demonstrates foundational Python skills by creating a fully functional quiz game. The application's core logic is to randomly quiz the user on the capitals of U.S. states. The game's data, including both states and capitals, is managed in an external Excel file, which the application reads and processes dynamically.

I developed this project to gain practical experience with key libraries and programming concepts, including:

Pandas: For importing and cleaning data from a .xlsx file.

Fundamental Python: Implementing core game mechanics such as loops, conditional logic, and user input validation.

Error Handling: Using try...except blocks to handle potential issues, like a missing data file.

This project showcases an ability to build a complete, interactive application from start to finish, from data ingestion to final user experience.
